Steps:
1) Create a decoding function. File alg.py
2) Analyse frequencies of files for Email 2, 3 and 4
    Check their frequencies are close to normal ones. These last ones are hardcoded for
    letters, bigrams and trigrams.
3) Find matching letters that follow the pattern where one letter appears in all three
    frequencies, and then replace them
4) Once done a matching for at least 10 letters, try to brute force the rest by using the fitness
    function to verify it englishness value.

Since this approach is not proved due to time constraint. It could not have been completed
in time.

File substitution.py obtains frequencies for a given text. Step 2.
