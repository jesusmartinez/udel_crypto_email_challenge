Steps:
1) Create a decoding function. File alg.py
    To test it individually, remove the commented lines and run it.
2) Analyse frequencies of files for Email 2, 3 and 4
    Check their frequencies are close to normal ones. These last ones are hardcoded for
    letters, bigrams and trigrams.
3) Find matching letters that follow the pattern where one letter appears in all three
    frequencies, and then replace them
4) Once done a matching for at least 10 letters, try to brute force the rest by using the fitness
    function to verify it englishness value.
5) Solution was performed manually after checking than most used frequencies matched to some hints.
6) To prove it, run substitution.py
File substitution.py obtains frequencies for a given text. Step 2.


TEXT:
I CONFESS THAT I HAVE BEEN AS BLIND AS A MOLE BUT IT IS BETTER TO LEARN
WISDOM LATE THAN NEVER TO LEARN IT AT ALL NEVER FORGET WHAT YOU ARE FOR SURELY
THE WORLD WILL NOT MAKE IT YOUR STRENGTH THEN IT CAN NEVER BE YOUR WEAKNESS
ARMOR YOURSELF IN IT AND IT WILL NEVER BE USED TO HURT YOU NO ONE IS EVER TOO
OLD TO DO A FOOLISH THING DO YOU KNOW ANYTHING ON EARTH WHICH HAS NOT A
DANGEROUS SIDE IF IT IS MISHANDLED AND ExAGGERATED NO PLACE WORTH KNOWING
YIELDS ITSELF AT SIGHT AND THOSE THE LEAST INVITING ON FIRST VIEW MAY LEAVE
THE MOST HAUNTING PICTURES UPON THE WALLS OF MEMORY MORNING MADE A CONSIDERABLE
DIFFERENCE IN MY GENERAL PROSPECT OF LIFE AND BRIGHTENED IT SO MUCH THAT IT
SCARCELY SEEMED THE SAME IGNORANCE IS THE PARENT OF FEARx
