Solution for Vigenere consisted of the following steps:

1) Follow recommendation of Module 1 Part 3 by analysing
a given encoded text.
    - Calculate its frequencies by a given Key Length
    - Key length is arbitrary is just a guess
    - Multiply frequencies by normal frequencies
File: part3_lesson1_problem.py
2) Loop from Key length 5 to 15
    - For all 5 given encoded texts, run file vigenere.py
    - Results produced different Key calculations which
    actually give a pseudo decoded text which doesn't look like english
    - However from all 5 emails. Number 1 gives a hint because
        - Key generated first was size 7 but we passed Key Length = 10
        - Key decoded some syllables similar to english
3) Improve algorithm above for email 1
    - It was observed that not all guesses in key approached to 0.065.
    For some of them it was less than the 0.005 threshold
    - So for those guesses I picked the highest value
Files: part3_lesson1_problem.py and vigenere2.py

How to verify:
    - Run vigenere2.py
    It reads file ch1 encoded from email 1 and decodes it

TRULY TO ENJOY BODILY WARMTH SOME SMALL PART OF YOU MUST BE COLD
FOR THERE IS NO QUALITY IN THIS WORLD THAT IS NOT WHAT IT IS MERELY
BY CONTRAST NOTHING EXISTS IN ITSELF WE SHOULD REGRET OUR MISTAKES
AND LEARN FROM THEM BUT NEVER CARRY THEM FORWARD INTO THE FUTURE
WITH US OH FRIEND JOHN IT IS A STRANGE WORLD AS AD WORLD A WORLD
FULL OF MISERIES AND WOES AND TROUBLES AND YET WHEN KING LAUGH COME
HE MAKE THEM ALL DANCE TO THE TUNE HE PLAY IT SEEMS TO ME NO WIFI
WAS TO FIND FATHER AT HOME TONIGHT I SHOULD BE HAVE DIFFERENT BUT
THERE S NO KNOWING PERHAPS NOTHING UD BE A LESSON TO US IF IT
DIDNâ€™T COME TOO LATE ALL THINGS ARE READY I FOUR MINDS BE SO SHE
INDULGED IN MELANCHOLY THAT CHEAPEST AND MOST ACCESSIBLE OF LUXURIES
DESPAIR HAS ITS OWN CALMS
